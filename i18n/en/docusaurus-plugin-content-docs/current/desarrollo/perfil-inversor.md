# Investor Profile

When a user registers in the system, a brief survey is conducted to create their investor profile and offer a personalized experience. This survey takes no more than 5 minutes.

The investor profile is a tool designed to understand each user's investment preferences, attitudes, and goals. Through a series of questions and evaluations, the system determines each user's investor profile. This profile is used to tailor investment recommendations to their style and risk tolerance, providing a more suitable and satisfying investment experience.

## Format

The survey will consist of 9 diverse questions, and the answers will be used to calculate a specific type of investor for each user.

## Investor Type

It is important to note that investor profiles are specifically applied to the context of the cryptocurrency market, which is characterized by its high volatility and associated inherent risks. Therefore, cryptocurrency recommendations within the top 10, 20, 50, or 100 by market capitalization are made considering this risk scenario and significant price fluctuations.

### Conservative

Conservative investors tend to prefer security and stability in their investments. They prefer to minimize risk and usually opt for more established and high-capitalization assets in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, they would be recommended cryptocurrencies that are in the top 10 by market capitalization, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other well-established projects.

### Moderate

Moderate investors have a moderate risk tolerance and seek a balance between stability and growth potential. They are generally willing to explore beyond the top cryptocurrencies but still prefer investing in assets with relatively high market capitalization and established reputation. They would be recommended cryptocurrencies that are in the top 20 by market capitalization, providing a variety of options beyond the major coins.

### Aggressive Moderate

Aggressive moderate investors have a higher risk tolerance and seek to maximize the growth potential of their investments. They are willing to explore a broader range of cryptocurrencies, including those with lower market capitalization but significant growth potential. They would be recommended cryptocurrencies that are in the top 50 by market capitalization, allowing access to more emerging projects with growth potential.

### Aggressive

Aggressive investors seek to maximize the growth potential of their investments and are willing to assume considerable risk. They are prepared to invest in riskier projects with lower market capitalization, hoping for significant long-term gains. They would be recommended cryptocurrencies that are in the top 100 by market capitalization, providing access to a wide range of emerging projects with high growth potential but also greater associated risks.

## Factors to Evaluate

The investor profile is established based on questions that assess their ability to assume risks and their tolerance for taking them.

### Ability to Assume Risks

The ability to assume risks is evaluated by considering current wealth, received income, stability, costs to cover current expenses, age, and medium-term liquidity needs.

Age is crucial for assessing the ability to assume risks, as a young investor with no medium-term liquidity needs has time to recover losses in their investment portfolio or in situations of unemployment.

### Tolerance for Assuming Risks

Tolerance for risk is evaluated through subjective questions about the investor's attitude towards different situations and their past experience with risky investments.

## Type Calculation

To determine the investor profile based on these questions, we can assign points to each answer and then sum the points to obtain the corresponding profile.
