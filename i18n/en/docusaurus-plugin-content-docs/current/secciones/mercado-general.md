# General Market

The General Market module is one of the most important as it serves as the home page of our system. This means it's the first thing users will see upon entering, so it has been designed to be as professional, comprehensive, and visually appealing as possible to create a good first impression of the system.

This template is divided into several sections, which are described below.

## Header - Navigation Bar

This component contains all the references to the sections present in the template. By clicking on one of these links, you will be automatically taken to the corresponding section.

The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the screen, meaning it will follow you as you navigate the page. Additionally, the section you are currently in is visually highlighted, making it easier to orient yourself on the page.

Finally, there is a button that allows you to log in or register in the system. Clicking this button will redirect you to the login or registration page, providing easy and quick access to your account.
