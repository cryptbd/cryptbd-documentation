# Wallet

Within the entire system, the "Wallet" module occupies a central place and is considered the most essential component. This module is divided into four fundamental components: "Balance," "Dashboard," "Transactions," and "Strategy and Simulation."

What makes this module even more efficient is its intuitive and simple interface. In a single template, users will find shortcuts to each of the mentioned components, making navigation and access to the most relevant tools in the system easier.
