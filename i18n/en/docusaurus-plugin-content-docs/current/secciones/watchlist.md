# Watchlist

In this module, users can access the list of coins they have marked as favorites for personalized tracking. In addition to viewing these coins, users have the option to compare them and generate charts for detailed analysis. Below, we describe these functionalities.

## Favorites

Firstly, a list of the coins that the user has marked as favorites is presented, offering the flexibility to remove those that are no longer of interest or to add new ones. Each coin is represented as a card, and these cards provide a series of fundamental data, including the current price, market capitalization, and trading volume.

By clicking on one of these cards, the system will redirect you to the "Specific Coin" module, allowing you to explore the selected coin in more detail. This functionality provides quick and easy access to detailed information about favorite coins.

## Comparative Charts

In this section of the template, users have the ability to select a minimum of two and up to four coins to generate comparative charts. It is important to note that these coins must be previously added to the user's favorites list to be compared.

It is relevant to mention that, since this functionality is in a beta version of the system, a sixty-second timer has been implemented. This measure aims to prevent multiple API requests within a short period of time.
